The gbeam.param file contains information on the beam position and raster.  One needs to use the corresponding gbeam.param with the appropriate run period. Currently, there are two files:

1. gbeam_fa23.param (exp: NPS Fall 2023 until Feb 20, 2024.  Last run number before maintenance on IPM3H07B was 4517.)
2. gbeam_sp24.param (exp: NPS after cabling work performed on IPM3H07B on Feb 20,2024)

BPM calibration information is available on the Hall C wiki: <https://hallcweb.jlab.org/wiki/index.php/BPM_calibration_information>
