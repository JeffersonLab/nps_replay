The gbeam.param file contains information on the beam position and raster. The lastest version in git is NOT always ideal. One needs to use the corresponding gbeam.param with the appropriate run period. Currently, there are three files:
1. gbeam_winter17.param (exp: commissioning in Dec 2017)
2. gbeam_spring18.param (exp: CT, F2, x>1, SIDIS)
3. gbeam_fall18.param (exp: CSV, KAON-LT)
4. gbeam_fa22.param (Fall 2022)
5. gbeam_fa23.param (exp: NPS)

The gbeam.param file is related to the gbeam_fall18.param file.
