Batch job submissions

Example sbatch scripts:
submit.sh: single job submission script. Take three inputs: run number, nevt, jobname.
submit_jobs.py: this script will create a sbatch submission script for each run and submit the jobs. Different options can be set from the command line. See the help page.
run.sh: executable

Alternatively, one can swif2 to submit batch jobs.
One of the easy ways to start is from https://github.com/JeffersonLab/hcswif
